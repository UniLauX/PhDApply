You are invited to attend a seminar given by professor Xin Yao from Southern University of Science and Technology, China (SUSTech) on Wednesday, 4th December, at 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM in Seminar Room 5.57, Level 5, Ingkarni Wardli.

Title: What Does the Newest Computer Science Department in China Look Like?

Speaker: Professor Xin Yao
Abstract: SUSTech is a "new kid on the block" in the Chinese higher education sector. This informal talk mainly introduces the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at SUSTech. The Department was set up in summer 2016 and now has 29 tenured and tenure track faculty members, including IEEE fellows. The talk will introduce our current faculty members and their research interests, the current research foci in the Department, the undergraduate, MSc and PhD programmes offered, and very exciting open positions for faculty members, research staff and postdocs. The compensation packages for our open positions are highly competitive with those offered in Australia, US and UK.There are also substantial support and subsidies from the Shenzhen government to outstanding candidates at all levels. 
The talk will be highly interactive and leave ample time for discussions and Q&A.

Bio-sketch of the speaker:
Xin Yao is a Chair Professor of Computer Science at the Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China, and a part-time Professor of Computer Science (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~xin) at the University of Birmingham, UK. His major research interests include evolutionary computation, ensemble learning and search-based software engineering. His work won the 2001 IEEE Donald G. Fink Prize Paper Award; 2010, 2015 and 2017 IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation Outstanding Paper Awards; 2010 BT Gordon Radley Award for Best Author of Innovation (Finalist); 2011 IEEE Transactions on Neural 
Networks Outstanding Paper Award; and many other best paper awards. He received a prestigious Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2012 and the IEEE CIS Evolutionary Computation Pioneer Award in 2013. He was recently selected to receive the 2020 IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award. Previously he served as the President (2014-15) of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and the Editor-in-Chief (2003-08) 
of IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation.
