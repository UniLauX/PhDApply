UniNet aim to unified friends of Uni to work together, rather than a neural network (Orginally I want to develop a unified network for detection,segmentation and tracking, but failed. lol), with the focus on the fields of Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Robotics, NLP and Graphics.

It provides three options: 

1. PhD, Visiting positions in academia.   

2. Full-time Job, Internships in Industry.

3. Research proposals /Co-paper.

Most of the job positions can be reached/recommended by Uni, that is why it is named UniNet.
